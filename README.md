# Project52 Golang Challenge

A project to write a small project everyweek. All projects are written by Golang. 


#Perface:

I saw a slide [reflectionsfrom 52 weeks 52 projects](https://speakerdeck.com/jeffersonlam/reflections-from-52-weeks-52-projects) and feel inspired. So, I hope I could learn something by doing the same challenge fo myself.

#Constraint:

Here is the constraints of Project52.

- The project could be small or big, but it should be something new not refactoring project.
- Programing language is not limited, feel free to write any language you just learn. (actually I am interest write some R package, because I just want to learn it.)
- Don't need to create brand new project, you could rewrite some exist project. (but on your own way, not allow to fork and refine.)
